# Coding Challenge

﻿Instructions:
-------------
Using .net develop a microservice exposing an API that writes log messages from external services to a text file. The messages are to include an id, a date and up to 255 characters of text.

Candidates are encouraged to improvise on any points they might normally seek clarification on from that brief. Candidates aren’t expected to spend more than 3 hours on the project and submitting an incomplete project is acceptable.
